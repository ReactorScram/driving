17:42 < g12345> i like the article... i really should read it :(
17:44 < ReactorScram> tragically, g12345 has hit his reading cap for the day :(
17:45 < g12345> it's past midnight
17:45 < ReactorScram> Is it possible that the price is dropping in proportiong to the dropping quality
17:49 < g12345> i dunno
17:49 < ReactorScram> how much undiscovered country is there in the genre of "platformer" after all
17:50 < g12345> lots
17:51 < ReactorScram> And yet when I see something 'big' like Shovel Knight
17:51 < ReactorScram> it's pixel art with a hero jumping around killing things 
17:51 < ReactorScram> on platforms
17:51 < ReactorScram> I need a new drug, metaphorically
17:52 < g12345> what do you mean? you don t like it?

17:54 < ReactorScram> I mean I think logically I must have watched the trailer
17:54 < ReactorScram> and remembered none of it
17:54 < ReactorScram> maybe it just needs a better trailer?
17:55 < g12345> well, i thought it was just another platformer
17:55 < g12345> then again i just played ducktales again
17:56 < g12345> i could easily finish it long ago
17:56 < g12345> but now i cant pass level 1
17:58 < ReactorScram> that happens to me sometimes

17:58 < ReactorScram> My thing with games is, I got bored of them
17:58 < g12345> well that specific game has you to hold the down button constantly
17:58 < ReactorScram> I'm waiting for something that has a new mechanic
17:58 < ReactorScram> Like when Portal came out
17:58 < g12345> my thumb cant handle that any more
17:58 < ReactorScram> nobody had seen that in a big game
17:58 < ReactorScram> weird

17:59 < g12345> im more of a nintendo type guy in that sense
17:59 < g12345> i like reinvention of the same over used mechanic
17:59 < g12345> but now in a way that it's actually fun to play
18:00 < g12345> yes, new idea are good too
18:00 < g12345> but im more of the "fun" type

18:01 < ReactorScram> I like having fun but most games don't strike me as fun anymore
18:01 < g12345> that can happen
18:01 < ReactorScram> For instance, I am still upset with Firewatch
18:01 < g12345> i havent went to a toy shop in months now
18:01 < ReactorScram> I paid $20 after seeing the trailer
18:02 < ReactorScram> and thinking it would be a mystery game set in beautiful wilderness where I walk around and cool stuff happens
18:02 < g12345> cool
18:02 < ReactorScram> The first 10 minutes was litle trickles of walking interspersed with some CYOA thing
18:02 < ReactorScram> That I really didn't care about
18:02 < g12345> aha
18:02 < ReactorScram> I think I was within my rights to give up on it
18:03 < ReactorScram> Also it showed a picture of the main character and I couldn't identify with it
18:03 < g12345> i am very picky with games too
18:03 < ReactorScram> It felt like it was forcing me to be someone else not letting me
18:03 < ReactorScram> brb
18:03 < g12345> okay
18:03 < g12345> i will read that article
18:03 <%NeiloGD> o/
18:03 < g12345> oi
18:04 < g12345> i mean this article: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/09/the-fallen-price-of-indie-games/

18:10 < g12345> "Sales screw your fans. Your fans love your games and eagerly await your next release. They want to get your game as soon as it comes out, at full price. But they are foolish to do that, because a sale is right around the corner. Even in economic terms, the extra utility of playing the game early, at release, is not big enough to offset the extra cost for most people. It makes more sense to...
18:10 < g12345> ...wait, unless they love you and your work so much that they're willing to throw economic reason out the window. It's nice to have fans that love your work that much. And these are the fans that you kick in the teeth when you put your game on sale."
18:10 < g12345> Also
18:10 < ReactorScram> hm
18:10 < g12345> "If just half of the players who buy the game during a 50%-off sale would have bought the game at full price if that was their only option, we'd already have a wash. What fraction of sale-waiting players fall into this category? I suspect way more than half."
18:10 < ReactorScram> back
18:10 < g12345> anyway, i was saying
18:10 < ReactorScram> inteersting point
18:11 < g12345> that I was very picky with buying games now
18:11 < ReactorScram> There is some traditional econ wisdom that if you lower prices you get more buyers and there is an ideal price point, but
18:11 < g12345> and I must say, 90% of my steam bought games, I really like them
18:11 < ReactorScram> but with games, the game is not something you need, they are basically all luxury goods to some extent
18:11 < ReactorScram> And the market is very stateful based on previous prices and expected future prices
18:11 < g12345> luxuries has a price point too
18:12 < ReactorScram> Also consider that each game can only be bought once
18:12 < ReactorScram> by a given person
18:12 < g12345> ask nintendo for that :P
18:12 < ReactorScram> true but generally you buy the game once
18:12 -!- RicoTyrell [rico@AN-BF77F821.plus.com] has joined #ludumdare
18:12 < ReactorScram> which means (most) every sale is a lost customer
18:12 < g12345> or the music industry
18:13 < g12345> well, i buy most games during steam sales now
18:13 < ReactorScram> yeah it is more like music or movies or books
18:13 < ReactorScram> it's shameful for a movie to be in the $5 bargain bin
18:13 < ReactorScram> And I don't know if they go on sales or just taper the price gradually - but a hit movie may be $20 for years
18:13 < g12345> not really
18:13 < g12345> i dont buy movies even if the costs $1
18:14 < g12345> i never have the time to watch them
18:14 < ReactorScram> Well there was a time
18:14 < ReactorScram> before you were born, when we had "DVDs"
18:14 < ReactorScram> and people bought movies, on purpose
18:14 < ReactorScram> to keep, even
18:14 < g12345> on purpose??? lol
18:14 < g12345> why you keep them if you dont watch them?
18:14 < g12345> i played every game i bought on steam
18:15 < g12345> sometimes a lot longer than most, too
18:15 < ReactorScram> I only bought maybe 5 or 10 games on Steam ever
18:15 < ReactorScram> I can't remember the last time I booted Steam
18:15 < ReactorScram> I don't like games anymore :(
18:15 < g12345> you're getting too old for games
18:15 < ReactorScram> yes
18:15 < g12345> as i said, i dont go to the toy shop any more
18:15 < ReactorScram> Also, many of the games I have enjoyed, don't run at all in WINE
18:16 < ReactorScram> Otherwise I would still be playing those games from 1998, 2005, etc.
18:16 < g12345> my next computer will be linux too
18:16 < g12345> so im not spending too much money on them
18:16 < ReactorScram> So it's hard for me to say "I want to be a game developer" when I don't like games and I do'nt even know why
18:17 < g12345> Funny, I know lots of people who say something like that
18:17 < g12345> "I want to be A, but I dont like A"
18:17 < ReactorScram> They say good writers have to read a lot of books
18:18 < ReactorScram> I don't like books much either, not fiction books anyway
18:18 < g12345> maybe
18:18 -!- `2kah [quassel@F0B615.28E2E9.1D32A8.B995C5.IP] has quit [Ping timeout]
18:18 < ReactorScram> I am not against reading, I just don't care for fiction
18:18 < g12345> I only make certain games for example
18:18 < ReactorScram> But I also don't practice writing so I'm not surprised that I am a bad writer, either way
18:18 < g12345> games that I don't like to play, I can't make them
18:18 < ReactorScram> yeah
18:18 < ReactorScram> It's also hard to make MP games when you are working alone
18:19 < ReactorScram> sort of a bootstrap paradox
18:19 < g12345> I always make games for myself
18:19 < g12345> so multiplayer... no
18:19 < g12345> funny thing is, "games for myself" is a very good niche, in my case
18:19 -!- `2kah [quassel@F0B615.28E2E9.1D32A8.B995C5.IP] has joined #ludumdare
18:20 < ReactorScram> that's good
18:22 < g12345> so if you found your own niche, you can still like making games
18:22 < g12345> maybe the world dont make those games, but you can
18:22 < ReactorScram> yeah
18:23 < g12345> have you found your niche yet?
18:23 < ReactorScram> Statistically the biggest slice of my games have been racing games
18:24 < ReactorScram> they are easy to make and involve some fun programming
18:24 < ReactorScram> But I haven't made any really good ones that people *want* to play
18:24 < ReactorScram> It's very skill-based which makes it replayable but not fun for casual play
18:24 < g12345> well, start with the person behind the mirror
18:24 < ReactorScram> yeah
18:24 < ReactorScram> I have not been doing my best on my games the last couple years
18:25 < g12345> I find that very strange, that other people like the games I made mostly for myself
18:25 < ReactorScram> well if you make it for yourself you will put more effort into making it good
18:25 < ReactorScram> I believe even a niche game can become popular if it's just very good
18:25 < g12345> if you make a game you like to play, there will be people who want to play them like you
18:26 < g12345> dont try to make games for *other people*
18:26 < g12345> FZero GX was also very skill based and not very casual,
18:26 < ReactorScram> F-Zero GX was the inspiration for Super Jet Racing
18:27 < g12345> but it has lots of fans
18:27 < ReactorScram> I didn't get all the way there
18:27 < g12345> I got stuck in level 2
18:27 < ReactorScram> The thing is, I don't enjoy playing F-Zero
18:27 < ReactorScram> it's really hard
18:27 < ReactorScram> And not that rewarding
18:27 < ReactorScram> I haven't bothered to turn on Dolphin
18:27 < g12345> what would you change about it then?
18:27 < ReactorScram> since new year's
18:27 < ReactorScram> tbh I dont' think I like racing games
18:27 < g12345> then make something else
18:27 < ReactorScram> I don't like the pressure to perform constantly for 3 minutes
18:28 < ReactorScram> With the only breaks being non-gameplay like menus
18:28 < ReactorScram> Okay well let me tell you about a game that enthralled me for years
18:28 < ReactorScram> Need For Speed Underground 2 was a racing game that was open-world, so I would go into free play mode and just drive around the highway that circled the city
18:28 < g12345> okay
18:28 < ReactorScram> at top speed
18:28 < ReactorScram> in the maxed-car I'd customized
18:28 < ReactorScram> and try not to hit traffic
18:28 < g12345> yes
18:28 < ReactorScram> Cause if you graze a car you get nitro but if you hit it you crash obviously
18:29 < ReactorScram> I played this 'mode' when I was bored during classes, etc.
18:29 < ReactorScram> Just trying to accumulate nitro and drive faster
18:29 < g12345> mmm
18:29 < ReactorScram> It wasn't stressful because there was no competing AI
18:29 < ReactorScram> The civilian traffic just drives at a norml 60 MPH ish
18:30 < g12345> have you played "Test Drive Unlimited"?
18:30 < ReactorScram> I did it as a way to experience the graphics and sound and see how many cars I could graze without crashing
18:30 < ReactorScram> no
18:30 < g12345> It's also an open world game where you can just drive around an island and you dont have to do anything
18:30 < g12345> Hawaiian island
18:31 -!- awsumpwner27 [awsumpwner@AN-DE5378E4.dynamic.mtsallstream.net] has quit [Ping timeout]
18:31 < ReactorScram> hm
18:31 < ReactorScram> Maybe I should work on that
18:31 < g12345> I think that's really something for you
18:31 < ReactorScram> Streets of Simcity was similar
18:31 < ReactorScram> It had a free drive mode
18:31 < ReactorScram> and missions
18:31 < ReactorScram> but there were no fixed tracks
18:31 < ReactorScram> you could arm your car with missiles and such
18:31 < g12345> yes, there are places where you can do missions
18:31 < g12345> but you dont have to
18:31 < ReactorScram> and just drive around blowing up buildings and cars
18:31 < ReactorScram> a bit like GTA if you couldn't walk
18:31 < g12345> and the island is a really large island too
18:31 < ReactorScram> g12345: I think you're onto something
18:32 < ReactorScram> I'll start small though
18:32 < ReactorScram> I wonder if there is such a thing as a puzzle / driving or adventure / driving game
18:32 < g12345> you should copy and keep this conversation
18:32 < ReactorScram> where the pace is not "as fast as possible all the time"
18:32 < g12345> and re-read this later
18:32 < ReactorScram> yeah
18:32 < ReactorScram> My IRC client has logging so I'll copy this out
18:33 < g12345> Test Drive Unlimited isnt sold anymore on Steam, license is expired, but you can still buy it physically on ebay for example
18:33 < ReactorScram> I think if I just write "streets / NFSUG2" on a sticky note and paste that on my tower I'll remember
18:33 < ReactorScram> huh
18:33 < ReactorScram> sounds like an open niche, then!
18:33 < g12345> I remember driving for fun in TDU
18:33 < g12345> watching the sun set
18:33 < g12345> driving around
18:33 < ReactorScram> the walking simulator of racing games
18:34 < g12345> also you said this: "buying some game thinking it would be a mystery game set in beautiful wilderness where I walk around and cool stuff happens"
18:34 < g12345> you like that idea too
18:34 < ReactorScram> yes
18:34 < ReactorScram> Fuel was sort of like what we're talking about
18:34 < ReactorScram> a big procgen open world
18:34 < ReactorScram> you would drive around and opt into missions / races
18:34 < ReactorScram> but you could just explore and drive
18:34 < ReactorScram> anywhere
18:34 < g12345> yes
18:34 < ReactorScram> That size of world is beyond me but the idea is not
18:34 < g12345> !
18:35 < ReactorScram> and it had all these biomes like burning forest fires, beaches, etc.
18:35 < g12345> well, TDU did that using satellite imagery
18:35 < ReactorScram> hm
18:35 < ReactorScram> I don't want to be obligated to be realistic
18:35 < g12345> you dont have to
18:35 < g12345> outrun was fun too, for example
18:36 < g12345> not because of the racing, but of the scenery
18:36 < ReactorScram> was that the 2D one?
18:36 < ReactorScram> psuedo3d arcade racing game?
18:36 < g12345> i play outrun coast to coast now
18:36 < ReactorScram> I think I know what you mean
18:36 < ReactorScram> I have Cannonball on my Pandora which is a FOSS port of it
18:36 < g12345> the latest version is fully 3d
18:36 < ReactorScram> ah
18:36 < g12345> but pseudo 3d is the original
18:37 < ReactorScram> I was thinking of this guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run
18:37 < ReactorScram> didn't know they made a sequele
18:37 < ReactorScram> also quick joke, if a game's story never gets continued, is that game NoSQL
18:37 < g12345> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OutRun_2006:_Coast_2_Coast
18:37 < g12345> :P
18:38 < g12345> I've seen both OutRun and OutRun 2 in the arcades
18:38 < g12345> but i somehow dont play them in those places
18:39 < ReactorScram> The port I have, Cannonball, is hard
18:39 < ReactorScram> I am not great at racing games
18:39 < g12345> I did played mario kart in the arcade hall
18:39 < ReactorScram> It seems the car never turns tight enough nor drives fast enough
18:39 < ReactorScram> Mario Kart is my kinda game
18:39 < ReactorScram> you can hold the throttle down and win
18:39 < ReactorScram> but it is a racing game
18:39 < ReactorScram> So if I mix Streets, NFSUG2, and Fuel I can get some good ideas
18:39 < g12345> OuRun is all about drifting and slipstream
18:40 < ReactorScram> I didn't know you could drift
18:40 < kdrnic> my economic theory is that the cost of creative works should be enough to pay those who made it for their time and fund the next venture, and no more
18:40 < g12345> thats not a venture
18:41 < g12345> anyway, i'd keep this conversation if I were you
18:41 < g12345> and I should try to go to bed soon
18:41 < ReactorScram> yeah
18:41 < ReactorScram> gn g12345 
18:41 < ReactorScram> I will think on this some more
18:41 < g12345> thanks for the chat
18:41 < g12345> i think you can be a good gamedev after all
18:41 < kdrnic> !define venture
18:41 < yaib> venture n 1: any venturesome undertaking especially one with an uncertain outcome 2: an investment that is very risky but could yield great profits; "he knew the stock was a speculation when he bought it" [syn: {speculation}] 3: a commercial undertaking that ...
18:41 < kdrnic> the way I see it fits perfectly the first definition
18:41 < g12345> see ^2
18:42 < kdrnic> words have more than one meaning
18:42 < kdrnic> it is the wonders of the human language
18:42 < ReactorScram> games are ventures, no?
18:42 < g12345> ReactorScram: also, try to find TDU, it's a great game
18:42 < ReactorScram> you are venturing to develop a game
18:42 < kdrnic> yes
18:42 < ReactorScram> g12345: I'll look up some no-commentary LPs
